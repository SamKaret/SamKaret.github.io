    "summary": "I recently graduated from Imperial College London with a Master's in Biomedical Engineering.\nI'm a passionate problem solver with wide ranging interests, and experience with medical devices, robotics, and 3D printing.\n\nMy degree involved various modules regarding biomechanics, medical imaging, and programming, as well as a variety of opportunities for project work, both large and small. Here are some examples of projects I worked on during my course:\n● A digital stethoscope.\n● A raspberry pi controlled robotic model tank with a turret to fire foam pellets. (For the Pi Wars Competition)\n● A bicycle pedal with live force feedback for a paraplegic athlete to use on a FES bike in the Cybathlon.\n● An arm wrestling arcade game.\n● Synthetic biological toggle switches.\n● A volumetric infrared imaging system (VIRIS) for the diagnoses and monitoring of breast-cancer related lymphoedema.\n\nI have experience working in both mechanical and electrical workshops, as well as in wet labs. I consider myself a 'maker' and a tinkerer and have skills in prototyping and working with microcontrollers. My experience using C++, python, and MATLAB has contributed to my ability to quickly pick up the usage of other programming languages.\n\nI am currently looking for work so feel free to reach out and contact me about any roles you think I'm suitable for.",
